## AWS Setup

### Create S3 Bucket

First Create the bucket

![AWS S3 Bucket](./Images/CreateBucket1.png)

For ACL and public access ensure that the first one is enabled and that the public access is granted (this for GHA to work and for the website to work to)

![AWS S3 Bucket Options](./Images/Bucket2.png)

Leave the rest of the options on default

Now that is created go to the propierties of your bucket and find the Static Website Hosting section and edit it

![AWS S3 SWH](./Images/SHOptions.png)
![AWS S3 Bucket Options 2](./Images/SWebsiteH.png)

Now go to the permissions tab, and in the bucket policy add the next json

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::<Your-bucket-name>/*"
        }
    ]
}
```

### SetUp AWS Role

To make AWS and GHA to interact with each other first we need to create an identity provider

![AWS Identity Setup](./Images/IdentityProvider.png)

Then we can create a role with the next config

In the Github organization we can put our github user in case we are using our personal account

And in the repository, the one that will trigger the workflow

![AWS Role Setup](./Images/CreateRole.png)

Skip the part of the permisions we will check that later. Then add a name for our Role and verify that the trusted entity is correct

![AWS Review Setup](./Images/ReviewCreateRole.png)

Go to the policies section and create a new one

![AWS Policy Setup](./Images/CreatePolicy.png)

Select JSON and copy and paste the next policy 

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "S3SyncPolicy",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:ListBucket",
                "s3:DeleteObject",
                "s3:PutObjectAcl"
            ],
            "Resource": [
              "arn:aws:s3:::<your-bucket-name>",
              "arn:aws:s3:::<your-bucket-name>/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

Once created, return to the role and attach this new policy to the role

![AWS Attach policy](./Images/AttachingPolicy.png)

## GitHub SetUp

Now you just need to update the secrets in the repository with the respective values

Go to setting of your repository and select actions under the secrets and variables

![GHA Secrets](./Images/Secrets.png)

| SECRET        | VALUE                                                             |
| :------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| AWS_ACCOUNT   | Numeric Value of your account you can get it from the Role ARN    |
| AWS_REGION    | Region of the Bucket, your can check it in the Bucket propierties |
| AWS_ROLE      | Name of the role that is already created                          |
| AWS_S3_BUCKET | Name of the s3 bucket                                             |

Now just push a new commit to the repo and wait for the workflow to finish

### ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
